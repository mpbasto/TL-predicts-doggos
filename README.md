# Using Transfer Learning and TensorFlow 2.0 to Classify Different Dog Breeds üêï

In this project, I used machine learning and data from [Kaggle's Dog Breed Identification Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data) to help identify different breeds of dogs. This kind of problem is called multi-class image classification, as there are mutliple different breeds of dog.

The model used is one pretrained in the domain of image classification from [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/4). It makes predictions with **MobileNet-V2**, a convolutional neural network that is 53 layers deep and a very effective feature extractor for object detection and segmentation.

Even though there are many ways of building a model in TensorFlow, bone of the best ways if one is getting started is to use the [Keras API's Sequential model](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/sequential_model).

### *Convolutional Neural Networks*

 There are a few articles worth reading, but this one by Sumit Saha was definitely my go-to when I was researching Convolutional Neural Networks:

 Sumit is a data scientist and machine learning engineer who can do some technical blogging too.
